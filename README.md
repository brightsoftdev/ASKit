# The framework of random snippets, in a neat Objective-C framework.

Call it a storage cupboard or a safe haven for random code, this contains any random classes I come up with that I might (or likely not) need again later on.

### Current classes
- ASPing
	- Checks if a host is up asynchronously or synchronously.
